# -Spotfiy-Data-Pipeline-End-To-End-Python-Data-Engineering-Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting data from Spotify using the Spotify API and processing it through Amazon Web Services (AWS) for analysis and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction:** Retrieve data on playlists, tracks, artists, and albums from Spotify.
- **Data Transformation:** Clean and process the data using Python.
- **AWS Integration:** Store and analyze data with AWS services.
- **Data Storage:** Utilize AWS S3 for scalable data storage.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform analysis and visualization with AWS athena and Amazon Redshift.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **API:** Spotify API
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS
  - AWS S3 (Data Storage)
  - AWS Lambda (Serverless Computing)
  - AWS Glue (Data Catalog and Crawler)
  - AWS Athena (Data Querying)
  - AWS CloudWatch (Monitoring and Triggers)
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - Spotipy (Spotify API Interaction)
  - Pandas (Data Manipulation)
 
## Workflow

**1. Data Extraction:**
   - Use the Spotify API to collect raw data on playlists, tracks, artists, and albums.
   - Store the raw data in AWS S3.

**2. AWS CloudWatch Trigger for Data Ingestion:**
  - Monitor new data arrival in S3.
  - Trigger AWS Lambda to process and store the raw data in S3.

**3. AWS S3 Trigger for Data Transformation:**
  - Upon detecting new data, trigger a Lambda function to transform the data and replace old data with the updated version.

**4. AWS Glue Crawler for Data Cataloging:**
  - Run AWS Glue Crawler to create and update the data catalog and table schema.

**5. AWS Athena for Data Analysis:**
  - Query the data directly from S3 using Athena for analysis and visualization.

## Conclusion

This project leverages Spotify API and AWS to create a scalable and efficient data pipeline for analysis and visualization. It lays the groundwork for advanced analytics and machine learning applications.
